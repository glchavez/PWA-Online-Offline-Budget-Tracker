# PWA-Online-Offline-Budget-Tracker

## Description

This application allows users to track their daily transactions. In doing so, they will be able to create a better budget with informed information on their spending habits.

Main challenges faced when creating this application was understanding the concept of a service worker and what code was required to do so. For future improvements, i would like to add a feature that tracks deposits and withdrawals, providing weekly and monthly reports on the totals for these two categories.

To view the live budget app, click [here](https://stark-mountain-04874.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

As a user, you will start with an empty budget page that contains the layout of the app. To get started, simply enter the name of your transaction, the cost amount, and click if this is to add funds or subtract funds. Once an option is clicked, the transaction will be added to the transaction list and shown in the overall budget graph.

The overall total from your added and subtracted funds will appear on the top of the page for quick reference.
